3. Go to the extensions page of your broswer (chrome://extensions if you're on chrome)
4. Enable developer mode. It should be a toggle in the extensions page
5. Click **load unpacked**, and select the folder you extracted in step 2

## FAQ

### Why can't I install this off the chrome webstore
It costs 5$ to put it up on the chrome webstore. I am too cheap to pay that.
